                    Casual trekkers along the Pacific Coast Highway have discovered 3 new species of Pokemon. These
                    species had previously only been theorised and this is the first time that any human had seen these
                    in the wild. Initial reports suggest that thses pokemon are not particulary dangerous and appear
                    quite friendly to humans. They seem especially fond of candy. One of the trekkers who first spotted
                    Bulbasaure said:

                    This is one of the cutest Pokemon we've ever seen. We could not believe we saw something like this.
                    This is the happiest day of my life.

                    Researchers are elated and cannot wait to find more such hidden Pokemon. Some researchers believe
                    over 200 such species exist in the wild.
